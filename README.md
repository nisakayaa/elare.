# ELARE 🌿  
**Artisan Kitchen & Plant-Based Products**

ELARE is a concept brand that combines a **plant-based café experience** with the sale of **natural and artisan food products**.  
Customers can both *experience the products in a café environment* and *purchase them for personal use*.

It is designed to showcase how a modern café brand can integrate:

- Physical café experience

The repository is part of my **software engineering portfolio** and demonstrates how a real-world brand can be structured and presented digitally.
